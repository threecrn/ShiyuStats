        "desc": "Astra Yao is widely regarded as Ridu's most iconic singer. With her extraordinary voice, stage presence, and songwriting talent, she has led the musical trends of an entire era. \"If music is the resonance of the soul, then Astra Yao is the spark that ignites it all,\" said one famous music critic.\n\nAs brilliant as she is, Astra remains remarkably sincere and pure. On stage, her voice resonates deeply with the audience, which has allowed her to amass a large and loyal fanbase known as her \"Astranauts.\" Of course, Astra's brilliance wouldn't be possible without the careful protection of her manager, Evelyn. Offstage, she appears to be just a cute, hapless girl who depends on Evelyn in her daily life, and on Wise and Belle in the Hollows.\n\n\"If I tickled Eous, would it make you laugh?\" Astra asked curiously while lifting the Proxy, who was linked via the HDD system.\n\nShe seems to have a particular fondness for Eous.\nContemplation: Human emotions are indeed an interesting subject. It's still hard to determine whether Astra likes Eous because of the owner, or whether she likes the owner because of Eous.",

Known for her calm, decisive decision-making and professional, efficient style, she's an irreplaceable pillar behind Astra. \"In terms of commercial value, if Astra Yao represents the 1, then Evelyn is all the 0s that follow,\" a reporter from an entertainment magazine stated.\n\nEvelyn is skilled at planning comprehensive schedules and product endorsements, while also ensuring Astra Yao's safety during any unexpected situations. \"Want to get close to Astra Yao? You'll have to get past Evelyn Chevalier first...\" Though she's always busy with work, Evelyn never seems overwhelmed, and she has an almost obsessive attention to detail, ensuring that every performance and every product endorsement goes through her strict scrutiny. But strangely, such an exceptional manager is not trusted by her parent company, Odeum HAE.\n\nIntel: Evelyn's role seems to go beyond just being a manager and personal bodyguard; there seems to be an \"organization\" behind her.\n\nIt seems a lot of people in Astra Yao's central Astranauts group ship them together.",
